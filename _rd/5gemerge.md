**Technology for advanced mobility systems and autonomous transport networks.**
	
ELASTIC has the three main objectives:

- ELASTIC will develop a **software architecture incorporating a new elasticity concept**, that will enable smart systems to satisfy the performance requirements of extreme-scale analytics workloads. The new elasticity concept will efficiently distribute the workloads across the compute continuum, whilst guaranteeing real-time, energy, communication quality and security non-function properties inherited from the system domain.
 
- The vision of ELASTIC is that by extending the **elasticity concept across the compute continuum in a fog computing environment**, combined with the usage of advanced hardware architectures at the edge side, can significantly increase the capabilities of the extreme-scale analytics integrating both responsive data-in-motion and latent data-at-rest analytics into a single solution.
 
- ELASTIC will consider a realistic yet visionary **[smart mobility use-case](https://elastic-project.eu/use-case)**, which will elaborate of huge amounts of data coming from a large set of IoT sensors distributed along the Florence tramway network. ELASTIC will adopt a very innovative federated/distributed fog architecture, supporting elasticity across the compute continuum whilst fulfilling real-time, energy, communication and secure properties.


**SixSq's role in the project:** 

Within the project, SixSq will facilitate the implementation of a transparent cloud to edge ecosystem, with support for cloud-native applications. This will make use of SixSq's expertise in **edge-to-cloud** and **edge-to-edge** products and services to enable smart city and IoT projects.
