<h2>About AI EdgeLabs</h2>

<p>Similar to our parent company, Scalarr, our solution at its core has a straightforward vision: to ensure security to the newest technologies. In the specific case of AI EdgeLabs, the solution was born out of the knowledge we earned from witnessing firsthand how clients were getting constantly attacked across their organisation’s Edge and IoT infrastructures, mostly due to lax security measures, outdated or unpatched systems, and a rising number of sophisticated cyber security attacks, to name a few.

With a diverse workforce based out of Ukraine, USA, Mexico, Poland, Israel, and Canada, AI EdgeLabs was founded and is run by security professionals that value humanity, safety, and favorable living conditions for every individual including social, economic, health, and any other factor that plays a part in human wellbeing.

We are the proud recipients of several acknowledgements, cementing our place as the industry’s most accurate solution in the market and culminating in being named one of Forbes’ Top 30 Best Ukrainian Startups in 2021.<p>
