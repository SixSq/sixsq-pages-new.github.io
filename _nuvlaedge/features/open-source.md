NuvlaBox is now fully open source software, and we ensure that the entire stack, including its dependencies, is Apache 2.0 compatible. This means that we leverage the latest innovations from the thriving open source communities, but also their maturity. From there, you are able to build your own edge-to-cloud journey, knowing that there is no lock-in.
