The NuvlaEdge software runs on most Linux operating systems, as long as they support Docker. We have also&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.nuvla.io/">documented</a>&nbsp;how to build your own Docker images. If you have your own Linux foundation and want to certify it run NuvlaEdge software, get in touch.
