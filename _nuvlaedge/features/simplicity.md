Smart factory settings and zero config means it’s a child’s play to set up and use. You can even ship your edge hardware with minimum configuration and let a non-expert in the field register and activate the devices running the NuvlaEdge software in a simple and secure manner. Combined with its&nbsp;<a href="/platform">Nuvla</a>&nbsp;remote-control capabilities, this means you don’t need IT experts on-site anymore. And you can watch and manage your growing edge assets from the comfort of your centralised Nuvla.io dashboard.
