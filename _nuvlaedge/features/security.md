Once powered-up, the NuvlaEdge powered device initiates a secured connection to Nuvla. Once the secured registration process is done, each NuvlaEdge is unique and assigned to a specific user account or group. This means that any device can be controlled remotely and isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded should any problems arise. We also work with expert partners to build the most secured edge solution, delivering solutions for stringent applications and highly regulated industries.
