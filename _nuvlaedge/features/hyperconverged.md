The NuvlaBox software turns any certified x86 and ARM platform into a hyperconverged system, where users can “carve” as much resources as needed for a given application. This means applications can happily run alongside each other, even on small devices, with minimum impact on each other. Via the&nbsp;<a href="/nuvla/platform">Nuvla.io</a>&nbsp;management platform, containerised applications can be dynamically deployed, monitored and updated, without needing to change the hardware.
