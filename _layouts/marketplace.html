You can even ship your edge hardware with minimum configuration and let a non-expert in the field register and activate the NuvlaBoxes in a simple and secure manner. Combined with its&nbsp;<a href="https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview">Nuvla.io</a>&nbsp;remote-control capabilities, this means you don’t need IT experts on-site anymore. And you can watch and manage your growing edge assets from the comfort of your centralised Nuvla.io dashboard.</p>

                        <p>SixSq is constantly scouting out new customers and app vendors. This is the fastest way we know for app vendors to find customers with a clear go-to-market and for customers to find the right app vendors to address their business challenges.</p>

                        <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://nuvla.io/">Nuvla.io</a>&nbsp;marketplace pricing scheme is simple and transparent. The app vendor sets the subscription price. The usage is metered by the day and invoiced monthly. SixSq takes a fee and pays the vendor the remaining amount on payment by the customer. The metering starts only after 24 hours, giving the customer time to explore and validate the purchase.<br></p>

                        <p>The Nuvla.io marketplace takes full advantage of the Nuvla.io&nbsp;<a href="https://nuvla.io/getting-started#architecture">architecture</a>, providing a complete lifecycle for apps deployed by customers on their edge and cloud infrastructures. Therefore, vendors are able to provide updates regularly, which Nuvla.io can apply with customer consent. Furthermore, customers can add, remove and swap apps at any time, with no penalties, in order to ensure they have the right apps to support their business.</p>

                        <p>Since the Nuvla.io marketplace is future proof, it also removes friction and therefore lock-in. The customer only pays for his or her consumption, by the hour, providing the freedom to change apps and apps vendors at any time. This reduces the risk of trying something new therefore benefits both app vendors and customers.<br></p>

                        <p>The Nuvla.io marketplace supports private Docker registries and credentials. This ensures only paying customers have access to any given version of the Docker images, therefore protecting vendor intellectual property.</p>
