The Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services is making a significant contribution towards transforming Switzerland into an internationally recognised hub for data-driven value creation. This organisation focuses on cooperation within an interdisciplinary expert network of innovative companies and universities with the aim of pooling knowledge from a variety of different areas, including information technology, artificial intelligence, business and psychology, in order to produce market-ready products and services.

The Allianceâ€™s website is a treasure trove of resources. It organises [events](https://data-service-alliance.ch/events/), has a rich series of [educational courses](https://data-service-alliance.ch/education/) and offers expert support to general public in the area of [Machine Learning](https://data-innovation.org/machine-learning-clinic/).
